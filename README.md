## Illustration

Complete accuracy of code cannot be guaranteed due to the randomness of execution. I have tested 2A over 150 times and 2B over 50 times, and no failed test cases haved occurred. The election timeout should be selected carefully. In my implementation, I opted low initial value but large interval between initial value and final value.
